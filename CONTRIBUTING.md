# Contributing

:tada: First of all, welcome to this repository, and thanks for your
interest, whether you want to contribute or simply are interested in
opening an issue.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change
you wish to make by creating an issue before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your
interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Before pushing your code, please make sure to have it covered by some
   unit tests. Please also make sure that the code passes both your
   tests and the other tests. Finally, please create clear, logically
   grouped commits and commit messages. Most any style guide will do;
   here's [a historical one for any divers in the
   team](https://github.com/torvalds/subsurface-for-dirk/blob/a48494d2fbed58c751e9b7e8fbff88582f9b2d02/README#L88).

2. Use the automatic pull request template to submit changes, even
   minor.

3. This project is developed using Python 3.7 (though later
   versions should work, too), and it follows, as much as possible, the PEP8
   (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) rules. You should enforce
   this behaviour and also use Pyflakes to check your code for unused
   libraries.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We expect you to use this code with respect for people involved in the analysis
of the references you want to parse.

### Our Standards

Examples of behaviours which contribute to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
